**A/B Testing E-Commerce Product Page**

**üìå Project Overview**

This project simulates an A/B test for an e-commerce platform to evaluate the impact of a redesigned product page on conversion rates. The business goal is to increase the average conversion rate from 13% to 15%.

To minimize risks of a full rollout, we design an experiment using a subset of users and validate results through statistical testing. We leverage a Kaggle dataset containing user sessions and conversions to simulate the experiment.

üéØ Business Problem
	‚Ä¢	Current conversion rate: 13%
	‚Ä¢	Target uplift: +2% (i.e., achieve ‚â•15%)
	‚Ä¢	Key Question: Does the new design significantly improve conversions compared to the old design?

üß™ Methodology

1. Experiment Design
	‚Ä¢	Control Group (A): Users exposed to old product page.
	‚Ä¢	Treatment Group (B): Users exposed to new product page.
	‚Ä¢	Independent Variable: Page design (old vs new).
	‚Ä¢	Dependent Variable: Conversion (0 = no purchase, 1 = purchase).

2. Hypothesis
	‚Ä¢	Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): p_{new} = p_{old}
	‚Ä¢	Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): p_{new} \neq p_{old}
	‚Ä¢	Significance Level (Œ±): 0.05 (95% confidence).

3. Sample Size Estimation
	‚Ä¢	Effect size calculated from 13% ‚Üí 15% expected uplift.
	‚Ä¢	Power = 0.8, Alpha = 0.05.
	‚Ä¢	Used power analysis with statsmodels to compute minimum sample size per group.

4. Data Preprocessing
	‚Ä¢	Removed duplicate users/sessions.
	‚Ä¢	Dropped bot traffic and incomplete records.
	‚Ä¢	Created binary conversion variable.

5. Statistical Testing
	‚Ä¢	Conducted a two-tailed z-test for proportions.
	‚Ä¢	Measured statistical significance (p-value).
	‚Ä¢	Compared uplift in conversion rates.
